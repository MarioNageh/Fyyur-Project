Fyyur

****
## Introduction

Fyyur is a musical venue and artist booking site that facilitates the discovery and bookings of shows between local performing artists and venues. This site lets you list new artists and venues, discover them, and list shows with artists as a venue owner.

Your job is to build out the data models to power the API endpoints for the Fyyur site by connecting to a PostgreSQL database for storing, querying, and creating information about artists and venues on Fyyur.

## Overview

This app is nearly complete. It is only missing one thing… real data! While the views and controllers are defined in this application, it is missing models and model interactions to be able to store retrieve, and update data from a database. By the end of this project, you should have a fully functioning site that is at least capable of doing the following, if not more, using a PostgreSQL database:

* creating new venues, artists, and creating new shows.
* searching for venues and artists.
* learning more about a specific artist or venue.

We want Fyyur to be the next new platform that artists and musical venues can use to find each other, and discover new music shows. Let's make that happen!


## Development Setup
1. **Download the project starter code locally**


2. **Create an empty repository in your Github account online. To change the remote repository path in your local repository, use the commands below:**
```
git remote -v 
git remote remove origin 
git remote add origin <https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO_NAME>.git>
git branch -M master
```
Once you have finished editing your code, you can push the local repository to your Github account using the following commands.
```
git add . --all   
git commit -m "your comment"
git push -u origin master
```

3. **Initialize and activate a virtualenv using:**
```
python -m virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
```
>**Note** - In Windows, the `env` does not have a `bin` directory. Therefore, you'd use the analogous command shown below:
```
source env/Scripts/activate
```

4. **Install the dependencies:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. **Run the development server:**
```
export FLASK_APP=myapp
export FLASK_ENV=development # enables debug mode
python3 app.py
```

6. **Verify on the Browser**<br>
